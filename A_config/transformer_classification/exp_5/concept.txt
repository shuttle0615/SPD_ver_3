on last experiment, we tested effect of repeated example to overfitting problem of the model. 

now we test if size of the model affect the underfitting of the model. (we only change the number of head and hidden layer size - twice) 

from last experiment, we noticed that by matching number of expected sample value to not overlapping, the over fitting was very improved. 
so for now, we will sattle with this data setup, where we use 100000 data points with 40 coins

we change lr to find best fit
